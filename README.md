# Airbnb-Predictions
In this report, we are interested in understanding the AirBnB Seattle dataset better through the lens of classification, regression and clustering algorithms. We want to predict AirBnB Seattle listings prices with the lowest error in order to help people price new listings. Also, each AirBnB listing also has a review score or undesirable or desirable, and our goal is to design a classifier for this variable that has the highest accuracy on new data.​ ​The data is sourced from the ​Airbnb​ site.
